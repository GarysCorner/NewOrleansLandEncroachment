# Audubon Park Land Encroachment

During my walks in audubon park I have noticed a concerning trend.  It appears at least to me that homeowners are appropriating the public parks intended for all of us to use for the own benefit.  The main vehicle for this appropriation seems to be adding in landscaping which acts as a barrier.  Typically cast-iron or bambo.  This is my attempt to figure whats going on
